Overview
This project is a Pathfinding Visualizer built using React. It helps visualize various pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's Algorithm, A Search*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS) on a grid. Users can interactively set start and end points, place obstacles, and watch how the algorithms explore the grid to find the shortest path.

Features
Interactive Grid: Users can select the start and end points, place walls (obstacles), and adjust grid size.
Multiple Algorithms: Visualize popular pathfinding algorithms such as:
Dijkstra's Algorithm
A* Search
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS)
Algorithm Visualization: Watch how different algorithms explore the grid to find the shortest path.
Real-Time Updates: The grid updates in real-time as the algorithms work their way through it.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on different devices and screen sizes.
